Configuring the Pipeline

Your Pipeline Run
-----------------
Before running the pipeline, some information must be provided to the pipeline.
In the current build of the pipeline, you, the user, will have to modify the 
<run.yaml> file located in the root of the project.  It looks something like
the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

Each field must have a value for the pipeline to run.  Listed below are
descriptions for each of the fields.  For more information about the yaml
file format, see the `official yaml website`_.
